title: About these notes
---

These are some notes regarding things I have learned. 

Each note will provide a summary of the most important points regarding the topic. This is useful for getting a higher-level understanding or refreshing your memory. If you want more details, you can use the resources at the end of the note as a curated list of resources.

The actual notes are versioned in <a href="https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this GitHub repository <svg class="embedded-fa-icon"><use href="#external-link-alt"></use></svg></a>.
