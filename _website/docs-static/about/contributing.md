Some goals I had when creating these notes:

-   Allow me to quickly get back up to speed on a subject that I investigated before
-   Help me structure my thoughts as I am learning new things

In order for those goals to be achieved, it's important that I am the only one writing these notes. Therefore, I will not accept any contributions to the repository (with the exception of minor spelling, grammar and attribution fixes).

If you want to build upon my work, feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the repository <svg class="embedded-fa-icon"><use href="#external-link-alt"></use></svg></a> or use the text in any other way while providing proper attribution (a link to this website or the repository is sufficient).
