title: Solving Leetcode Questions
---

These are some of the techniques that I usually follows while attending any Leetcode contest/Problem.

-   Go through the problem carefully and think about the problem in the following ways:
    -   Can the problem be divided into sub-problems?
    -   What is the key idea behind the problem?
    -   What is the key idea behind the goal?
    -   Which Data-Structure will fit in for each of the sub-problems?

Once you have all the above written down or thought of, you can start coding.
-   List down all the sub-problems in the main problem.
-   Try to solve the sub-problem in the best possible way.
-   Generate complexity for the sub-problem which will be used in the main problem.
-   Generate the code for the sub-problem.
-   Generate the code for the main problem.
