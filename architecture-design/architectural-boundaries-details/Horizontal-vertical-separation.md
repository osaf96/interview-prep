## Horizontal slicing

-   Boundaries between different technical areas (layers) of the system
-   Example: a layer for the API, a layer the business logic and a layer for communicating with the database
-   Benefit: allow for technological flexibility (for example, relatively easy to switch to other kind of DB)
-   Drawback: single functional change is likely to affect multiple layers

## Vertical slicing

-   Boundaries between different functional areas of the system
-   Example: functionality for managing customers can be separated from functionality for placing orders
-   Benefit: Changes within a single functional domain can happen within a single part of the system
    -   Especially helpful if different parts maintained by different teams!
    -   Changes within a single functional domain can happen within a single team and coordination with other teams is only required if the communication with other functional domains needs changes as well
    -   See [Architecture and people - Conway's law](../Architecture-people.md#conways-law)
    -   See [microservices](../reference-architectures/Microservices.md), where different small teams each maintain one or more microservices that encapsulate a certain functional area across several layers of the technical stack, even down to the database
