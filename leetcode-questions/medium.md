}
```

    Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
    Output: [7,0,8]
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

    Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
    Output: [0]

    Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
    Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

}
```

    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
